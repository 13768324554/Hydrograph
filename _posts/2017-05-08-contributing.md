  <h1>Contributing to Hydrograph</h1>
</div>

As an open source project Hydrograph welcomes contributions from all users interested in adding new 
features. However, in the spirit of open source software we want to make sure that we're delivering 
a quality project to the community. For these reasons we're piloting an enhancement model based on 
GitHub's issue tracker and project board features. 

GitHub's issue tracker provides a way for contributors and users to propose enhancements, and 
will serve as a forum for discussion while the scope and feature set of the enhancement are 
established. For a step-by-step guide on proposing an enhancement take a look at 
[Propose an Enhancement](proposeAnEnhancement). 

GitHub's project board feature provides a simple interface that allows users to track the progress
of enhancements - from proposal to integration with a Hydograph release. To understand how the
project board is used to track work see [Project Board Overview](project-board-overview).
